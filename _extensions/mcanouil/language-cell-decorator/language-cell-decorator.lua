--- Extracts filename and language from a code block, decorates it for Quarto rendering.
--- Supports extracting filename from special comment syntax: `language | filename: name.ext`
--- Also handles language extraction from cell-code blocks and template syntax.
--- The extracted language is displayed in uppercase as a decoration label.

--- @param code table The code block object from Quarto AST
--- @return table Decorated code block with filename and language attributes if found, otherwise original code block
